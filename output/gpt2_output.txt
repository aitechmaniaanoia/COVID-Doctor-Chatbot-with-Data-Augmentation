Reference: Antibiotic   I don't recommend antibiotics for a simple viral upper respiratory tract infection unless examination revealed signs of acute bronchitis or sinusitis.   They are not effective for viral infections like coVid 19 with no bacterial lung involvement either. If you've been exposed to someone with coVid 19 or or if you or someone you were exposed to travelled to a region where it was endemic, get tested  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
Predict: It depends on your age and what type of infection you have. If you have a history of pneumonia, you might need to take a test to find out if it is contagious. If

Patient: I have pain/discomfort in my lungs. I don't experience simultaneous on both lungs and it not always at the hame position. I don't have a head nor do I have high temperature. I sneeze and cough maybe once a day. Do I have corona, should I get tested?
Reference: Exam needed. You are assuming that the discomfort is coming from both lungs, but pain of pleurisy or pneumonia wouldn't come and go In different sites. I doubt your symptoms are lung related, but fever, chills, sweats, worse cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, warrant testing.. If you've been exposed to someone with covid, or if you or someone you were exposed to  travelled to an affected region, get tested.
Predict: I have had this. You are more likely to get the COVID-19 virus. You may be ill. You should also consult a physician. If you have any symptoms,

Patient: Why are so many people with diabetes dying from the coronavirus? It’s really frightening me.
Reference: Immunocompromised    body is busy dealing with diabetes, not as much resiliancy remaining to fight viral symptoms, and subsequent opportunistic infections  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
Predict: No, but you are in good hands. You should not worry about it.   If you have a heart attack or have a fever or a fever, you should not be worried about it, but it is very unlikely that you are not having a heart condition.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?

--------------------example 14--------------------
Patient: I'm just a bit concerned as I have a sore throat and coughing a little bit as a result of my sore throat. My upper body is also aching a bit. Is this a cause for concern?
Reference: Possible virus. This is likely a viral infection. If you have a fever and/or the cough or sore throat get worse, you should be examined by your doctor. If you've been exposed to a particular illness, such as strep or the flu or coronavirus, you may need to be tested.For now, rest, drink fluids, take acetaminophen or ibuprofen as needed if you have no medical contraindication.
Predict: Not really.    cough and cough are very common symptoms of COVID-19.  The cough is a common cause for the sore throat, but you have no other symptoms.  cough, cough, and throat pain are the most common symptoms.

--------------------example 15--------------------
Patient: Will Lysol wipes kill coronavirus? How long can coronavirus live on household surfaces?
Reference: Several days   Lysol should  be good.    Seehttps://www.wired.com/story/coronavirus-disinfectant-cleaning-guide/  Would you like to video or text chat with me?

Patient: Is it necessary to get tested for the corona virus if you arrive back in South Africa after visiting Zimbabwe and Victoria falls as part of a group?
Reference: It depends.   If the visited place has a high rate of coronavirus infections to take some precautions is important such as if you develop fever or cough or any other coronavirus infection symptoms.   To be tested is desired but will you be able to get tested? In some places testing kits are reserved to very sick and hospitalized patient. Self quarantine in cooperation with your doctor is the way to go.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
Predict: Not a virus. It is a virus that has spread through the country, and the virus is not contagious to anyone. It has spread to all of Africa, and is not a virus, but a virus which has spread from one country to another.

Patient: Hi. This COVID-19 outbreak is scary. I got screened this week and it was negative. But prior to screening I had a week of continuous dry coughs and also throat was sore. I've put myself in a quarantine. What next? Do I still need to screen again?
Reference: Screening test if. If you develop symptoms of dry cough, fever and/or shortness of breath, consider re testing since the test may convert to a positive test if infected. Other causes should be considered including an allergic reaction. Try one dose of an antihistamine and gauge improvement. Stay at home for three days if there is no fever. .
Predict: Hello,    If you have a fever or sore throat, then you need to see a doctor.   Would you like to video or text chat with me?

--------------------example 19--------------------
Patient: Is it true (or a myth) that coronavirus will not survive hotter climates. As summer approaches, is it expected to reduce in tropical summers at least.
Reference: Coronavirus.    Yes, according to previous knowledge, most virus including coronavirus likely will not survive hotter climates.   I would expect or hope this will die down in summer time. Nevertheless, this is new coronavirus, let's wait and see. I also think that with strong human intervention, the virus may reduce or be eliminated before summer.   Would you like to video or text chat with me?
Predict: Yes but coronaviruses are not immune to COVID 19. The coronaviro virus is not transmitted through air. The virus is transmitted through COVID19.

--------------------example 20--------------------
Patient: I heard ACE inhibitors might exacerbate coronavirus. I also heard NSAIDs might do the same. Does this mean any common meds could have an unexpected effect during coronavirus?
Reference: Coronavirus and ACEI.   Recent publications including the one from the lancet showed COVID-19 binds to ACE-2 receptor on target cells for entrance.   The expression of ACE-2 receptor is substantially increased in patients with diabetes who were treated with ACE inhibitors or ARB. NSAIDS has the similar effect. All medications can have some unexpected side effects.    Would you like to video or text chat with me?
Predict: No. They are not controlled for coronaviruses. The only way to know if the coronaviral virus is effective is to test for Covid-19.

--------------------example 21--------------------
Patient: I have had mild chest pain for over a week. it now seems more persistent and pronounced. I don't have shortness of breath or any other COVID-19 symptoms, except some fatigue. I have been traveling a lot in high risk areas. Should I get tested?
Reference: Yes   I would advise screening due to your exposure.   Fever is very commonly associated with COVID-19. Stay at home, rest, drink fluids and monitor your temperature. Arrange the testing which also  may include a chest image with your PCP.  Since your have been traveling, a pulmonary embolism is another possible cause of your shortness of breath.   Would you like to video or text chat with me?

--------------------example 23--------------------
Patient: I have shortness of breath and are worried, I don’t have a cough or sore throat, so they will not test me, should I do a private test?
Reference: Shortness of breath. Covid testing is hard to come by. At 37 you are in a lower risk group.  And I doubt you could get a test. Keep isolated for two weeks. I know we have been ordering tests through HealthTap, but that does not lead to getting the test done, due to shortages. (3/21/20).
Predict: Yes, but it depends on your temperature and sensitivity, which are very important to know. You should be alright.

--------------------example 24--------------------
Patient: How do you get HPV on the cervix? Is it from skin to skin contact during intercourse from a partner’s genital touching the cervix? Thank you.
Reference: Basically the HPV virus is transferred within fluids generated during intercourse.   A mechanical skin contact appears to be part of the process but defining the exact amount of contact required is difficult. The genital strains of HPV are specific to those locations. There are other HPV strains that cause things like skin warts but these are different.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
Predict: No. It is not a virus. It depends on the type of virus. The virus is spread by the person who has had the virus.

Reference: During this pandemic. Throat pain can be from a strep throat infection (antibiotics needed), a cold or influenza or other virus, or from some other cause such as allergies or irritants. Usually, a person sees the doctor (call first) if the sore throat is bothersome, recurrent, or doesn't go away quickly.

Patient: I have a dry cough and sore throat- it's been a week now and the cough seems to be getting worse- no runny nose or fever, sometimes a headache, no shortness of breath...should I get tested for covid19?
Reference: COVID   Good guidelines can be found at cdc.  gov/coronavirus/2019.  You would be considered low risk. Symptoms last up to two weeks. High probability many will get the disease and testing leads to no change in action at this time.  No obvious therapy (however some encouraging possibilites) and for most people the virus runs its course without incidence. Stay put and talk to your provider.

Patient: If you've been infected by SARS-CoV-2, develop Covid-19 symptoms and recover, can you: 1) develop immunity to Covid-19 2) infect others after 14 days post-symptom onset & recovery 3) get re-infected later by SARS-CoV-2 despite developing immunity?
Reference: Yes, Maybe, Maybe. We presume one is immune to a respiratory virus for a while after getting the infection (that's the way it is with other viruses). A few people have trouble with their antibodies and don't have much immunity. Shedding of viruses sometimes is longer than 14 days. In life, there will always be some people who get reinfected, for whatever reason. Usually one is immune after the infection. (3/21/20).
Predict: Yes, you can. You can get the virus and recover.

Those who have high risks (age over 65, chronic diseases) tend to get pneumonia and complications. The most important way to prevent the complications is not to get infection, practice common sense of prevention. If you catch the infection, start early treatment.

Predict: Don't get coronovirus. Avoid contact with other people with the same symptoms.
